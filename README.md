# T5-Exploration-With-Flan-T5-Fine-Tuning 📚

This repository contains code and resources for an NLP project focused on text summarization using Flan-T5 and fine-tuning the T5-Small model. The project is organized into several directories and sections, each serving a specific purpose.

## Folder Structure 📁

### Codes 💻

- **FlanT5_implementation**: Explore the Flan-T5 model for initial text summarization tasks.
- **T5Small_FineTuning**: Fine-tune the T5-Small model for customized text summarization.
- **FineTuned_T5_Small_Model**: Store the fine-tuned T5-Small model and its related files.

### Datasets 📂

- **Original_Dataset**: Store the original text data used for the project.
- **Preprocessed_Data**: Contains preprocessed datasets and intermediate files for model training.

### Evaluation Scores 📊

- **all_scores_Flan-T5**: Keep the evaluation scores obtained using the Flan-T5 model.
- **all_scores_T5-small**: Store evaluation scores after fine-tuning the T5-Small model.

### SMA_Final_Report 📝
- Consists of more details about teh scores and the dataset for better understanding
